# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to explain how to install genomes from NCBI in your RSAT server. 


# Prerequisite

This protocol assumes that you have a working instance of the RSAT server, and that you are familar with the Unix terminal. 

# Protocol

We illustrate the installation procedure with a bacterial genome, since NCBI is the main source of prokaryote genomes for RSAT (<http://prokaryotes.rsat.eu/>). The same procedure can however apply to other taxa, as far as they are available on the NCBI FTP server (<ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/>).

## Data source

Genomes are downloaded from the refseq repository: <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq>

## Getting the list of available species

The first step to perform with the command `Ã¬nstall-organisms` is to get the list of organisms available for a given taxonomic group. 

The NCBI FTP genome site is organised by "main" **taxonomic groups**: 

- [archaea](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/archaea/)
- [bacteria](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/)
- [fungi](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/fungi/)
- [invertebrate](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/invertebrate/)
- [plant](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/plant/)
- [mitochondrion](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/mitochondrion/)
- [plasmid](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/plasmid)
- [plastid](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/plastid)
- [protozoa](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/protozoa/)
- [vertebrate_mammalian](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/)
- [vertebrate_other](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_other/)
- [viral](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/viral/)

The option `-task available` returns the complete list of available species for the specified group. 

The command below gets the list of all available bacteria and stores them in a text file. 

```{bash available_bacteria, eval=FALSE}
## Get curret date to use as suffix for output files
export TODAY=`date +%Y-%m-%d`

## Get the list of bacterial species available on the NCBI FTP site
install-organism -v 1 -group bacteria -task available \
  -o available_bacteria_${TODAY}.txt
  
## Count the number of species.
## Note: grep is used to filter out the comment lines.
grep -v '^;' available_bacteria_${TODAY}.txt | wc -l
```

We can of course do the same for other taxa, for example Archaea, Fungi or Mammalian. 

```{bash available_genomes, eval=FALSE}
export TAXA='archaea bacteria fungi invertebrate
plant mitochondrion plasmid plastid protozoa
vertebrate_mammalian vertebrate_other viral'

for taxon in $TAXA; do \
  echo "Getting list of NCBI species for ${taxon}" ; \
  install-organism -v 1 -group ${taxon} -task available \
  -o available_${taxon}_${TODAY}.txt ; \
done

## Approx count of species per taxa
## (the number of comment lines should be substracted from each count)
wc -l available_*_${TODAY}.txt | sort -nr
```

Here is the result on Dec 12, 2017. 

| 25641 | total |
| 16750 | available_bacteria_2017-12-12.txt |
| 7399 | available_viral_2017-12-12.txt |
| 546 | available_archaea_2017-12-12.txt |
| 260 | available_fungi_2017-12-12.txt |
| 170 | available_invertebrate_2017-12-12.txt |
| 139 | available_vertebrate_other_2017-12-12.txt |
| 124 | available_vertebrate_mammalian_2017-12-12.txt |
| 114 | available_plant_2017-12-12.txt |
| 94 | available_protozoa_2017-12-12.txt |
| 15 | available_plastid_2017-12-12.txt |
| 15 | available_plasmid_2017-12-12.txt |
| 15 | available_mitochondrion_2017-12-12.txt |


**Notes** 

- The **number of available genomes** exceeds by far the number of species, because some species are represented by different strains, in particular for bacteria (for some bacterial species of interest for health, several thousands of strains have been sequenced). 

- Some of these genomes are only partly sequenced, or poorly assembled, and the level of annotation is quite variable. NCBI subdivided these available genomes in 4 categories depending on the level of completion of the sequencing project. 




## Installing the genome for a given species

### Download the genome(s)


```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Download the genome(s) for a given species 
## (e.g. Rhodospirillum_centenum)  
install-organism -v 1 -group bacteria \
  -species Rhodospirillum_centenum \
  -task download
```

**Notes**

1. The option `-species` requires to specify the Genus (with a leading uppercase) and species (in lowercases) separated by an undescore (_), with exactly the same spelling and cases as on the NCBI FTP refseq site. 

2. Downloaded genomes will be installed in a folder `$RSAT/downloads/refseq` on your computer. 

3. **Beware:** for some bacterial species of particular interest (e.g. important human pathogens), tens of thousands of strains have been sequenced. It might cost a lot of time and disk space to download all of them. TO avoid that, you can specify the full strain name (more precisely the subfolder corresponding to the strain of interest in the species folder on the NCBI FTP site). 

### Listing the available strains for the species of interest

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## List the available strains for a given species (e.g. Rhodospirillum centenum).
install-organism -v 1 -group bacteria \
  -species Rhodospirillum_centenum \
  -task list
```

This command actually lists the folders. 

### Parsing the genomes

Parsing consists in extracting the information from a text-formatted file, in order to organise it in a computable structure. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Parse one genome (e.g. Rhodospirillum centenum)
install-organism -v 1 -group bacteria -species Rhodospirillum_centenum -strain Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1 -task parse
```

This creates a folder whose name is the concatenation of the genus, species and strain names:  `$RSAT/public_html/data/[Genus_species_strain]`

From now on we will directly refer to this concatenated name as the "Organism name" (generally denoted by the option `-org` in RSAT commands. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Check the parsing result
ls -l /workspace/rsat/public_html/data/genomes/Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1/genome/

## Measure the disk space occupied by this genome (note: this will be increased in the subsequent steps)
du -sm /workspace/rsat/public_html/data/genomes/Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1/genome/
```

This gives the number of megabases occupied by the genome folder. 

### Adding the parsed genome to the list of supported genomes

In order to make the parsed genome available for RSAT, you need to run the configuration task.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Configure the organism for RSAT
install-organism -v 1 -org Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1 -task config


## Check that the organism has weel been declared
supported-organisms -taxon Rhodospirillum

```

### Finalizing the installation

Several more tasks need to be performed before we can consider this organism as "installed". 

The simplest way to run it is to select the "default" tasks. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Run the installation task (retrieve upstream sequences compute background oligo and dyad frequencies, index fasta genome for bedtols, ...)

install-organism -v 1 -org Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1 -task default

```

#### Detailed list of supported installation tasks (default and others)

| Task | Meaning                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| default | run all the default tasks useful for the installation of a genome (this is a subset of the tasks specified below) |
| start_stop | compute trinucleotide frequencies in all the start and stop codons (validation of the correspondance between genome sequences and gene coordinates) |
| allup | Retrieve all upstream sequences in order to compute the background models (oligonucleotide and dyad frequencies) |
| seq_len_distrib | Compute the distribution of upstream sequences |
| genome_segments | SPlit the genome into segments corresponding to different genomic region types: genic, intergenic, ... |
| upstream_freq | Compute oligonucleotide or/and dyad frequencies in upstream sequences (must be combined with tasks oligos and/or dyads) |
| genome_freq | Compute oligonucleotide or/and dyad frequencies in the whole genome (must be combined with tasks oligos and/or dyads) |
| protein_freq | Compute amino acid, di- and tri-peptide frequencies in all protein sequences |
| protein_len | Compute distribution of protein lengths |
| oligos | Compute oligonucleotide frequencies (size 1 to 8) in a given type of sequences. Must be combined with stasks upstream or genomic |
| dyads | Idem for dyads, i.e. spaced pairs of trinucleotides |
| fasta_genome | convert genome sequence in fasta in order to make it usable by bedtools | 
| chrom_sizes | compute chromosome sizes from genomic sequences |
| index_bedtools | index genome to enable its ultra-fast processing by bedtools |
| uninstall | uninstall a genome, i.e. stop displaying it as available. Beware, this does not erase the genome folder, for this you can use the option `-task erase`|
| erase | Erase the whole folder of your organism in `$RSAT/public_html/data` |

### Checking that the organism is well supported

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Get all the organisms of the Genus Rhodospirillum
supported-organisms -taxon Rhodospirillum
```

### Checking the correctness of gene annotations by computing start/stop codon frequencies

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Retrieve all the start codon sequences
retrieve-seq -all -org Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1 -from 0 -to 2 -o start_seq.fasta

more start_seq.fasta

## Check that most genes have ATG as start codon
oligo-analysis -v 1 -i start_seq.fasta  -l 3 -1str -return occ,freq -sort | more

```

You can do the similar test with the stop codon frequencies. Note that nothing forces you to store the stop codong sequences in a local file, you can use the pipe symbol ` | ` to concatenate two commands. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Compute all trinucleotide frequencies in the stop codons
retrieve-seq -all -org Rhodospirillum_centenum_GCF_000016185.1_ASM1618v1  -type downstream -from -1 -to -3

more start_seq.fasta

## Check that most genes have ATG as start codon
oligo-analysis -v 1 -i start_seq.fasta  -l 3 -1str -return occ,freq -sort | more

```

## Installing many genomes


## Selecting bacterial organisms with Complete genomes or Chromosomes

The NCBI file ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/assembly_summary.txt contains annotations referring to the status of the genome projects.

NCBI Assembly classifies genome assemblies in four levels:

1. Contig: Assemblies that include only contigs.
2. Scaffold: Includes both scaffolds and contigs.
3. Chromosome: Includes chromosome or linkage groups, plus scaffolds and contigs.
4. Complete genome: Assemblies for which all molecules are fully sequenced.

Reference: PMCID: PMC4702866

In this case in order to work with fully sequenced bacterial genomes and chromosomes we will select genomes with "Chromosome" and "Complete Genome" annotation in this field.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Dowload the ftp file
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/assembly_summary.txt

## Select only the genomes with a Complete or Chromosome annotation in the field assembly_level
mv assembly_summary_refseq.txt ncbi_organisms_assembly_summary_bacteria_refseq.txt

awk -F "\t" '($12=="Chromosome" || $12=="Complete Genome") && $11=="latest"{print $0}' ncbi_organisms_assembly_summary_bacteria_refseq.txt > chromosome_and_complete_bacterial_genomes.txt

```
Using the list of available bacterial genomes we can select only those with the amount of annotation we consider appropriate.
