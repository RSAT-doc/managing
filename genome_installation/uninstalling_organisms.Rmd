# Uninstalling organisms from RSAT

Let us imagine that we don't need an organism anymore nd we want to suppress it from the list of available organisms on our RSAT server. 

A concrete case: in the tutorial "[Installing genomes from Ensembl and EnsemblGenomes](install_organisms_from_ensembl.html)" we installed *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* for the sake of test. After that, we installed the human genome, and since everything worked fine we would now like to suppress the version of *Saccharomyces cerevisiaie* downloaded from Ensembl. 

We first need to identify the particular version that we installed from Ensembl. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
## Identify the full name of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome 
## that was downloaded from Ensembl
supported-organisms -source ensembl -taxon Saccharomyces
# result (2018-08-06): Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1

## Disable the usage of this genome (without deleting the files)
install-organism -org Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1 -task uninstall

## Check that this organism is not supported anymore
supported-organisms -source ensembl -taxon Saccharomyces
## Gives no result

## Check if the genome data is still there in the RSAT genome folder.
du -sm $RSAT/public_html/data/genomes/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1
## Result: the folder is still there and occupies 39Mb

## Erase the genome data 
install-organism -org Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1 -task erase

## Check if the genome data has well been removed now
du -sm $RSAT/public_html/data/genomes/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-1-1
## Result: "No such file or directory"
```
